# Midas Touch: Investor Similarity Scoring

The objective of the project, internally known as Midas Touch, was to develop tools which would allow computing the similarity between different investors based on their previous investments, and for each investor to identify other Venture Capital firms (VCs), whose investing decisions have been most similar in the past. Better understanding the investment decision and investment patterns of early-stage investors, in particular of the long-tail investors who are not as well known or recognizable, can then allow to make more informed decisions about the growth potential of startups.

During the project, two main functions were developed: $\verb|n_nearest_neighbours|$ and $\verb|plot_n_nearest_neighbours|$, the main aim of which is to identify and visualise the $n$ investors most similar to the analysed investor. The functions rely on four different similarity measures, and on top of that allow to specify a number of parameters, which allow for a more detailed and targeted analysis of the similarity.
